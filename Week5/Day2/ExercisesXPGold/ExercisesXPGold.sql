-- üåü Exercise 3 : Items and Customers (use public database)

-- Part I: Create purchases table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS purchases;

CREATE TABLE purchases (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    item_id INT REFERENCES items(item_id),
    quantity_purchased INT
);

-- Insert purchases with subqueries
INSERT INTO purchases (customer_id, item_id, quantity_purchased)
VALUES (
    (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE first_name='Scott' AND last_name='Scott'),
    (SELECT item_id FROM items WHERE name='Fan'),
    1
);

INSERT INTO purchases (customer_id, item_id, quantity_purchased)
VALUES (
    (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE first_name='Melanie' AND last_name='Johnson'),
    (SELECT item_id FROM items WHERE name='Large Desk'),
    10
);

INSERT INTO purchases (customer_id, item_id, quantity_purchased)
VALUES (
    (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE first_name='Greg' AND last_name='Jones'),
    (SELECT item_id FROM items WHERE name='Small Desk'),
    2
);

-- Part II: Queries on purchases

-- 1. All purchases
SELECT * FROM purchases;

-- 2. All purchases joined with customers
SELECT p.id, c.first_name, c.last_name, p.item_id, p.quantity_purchased
FROM purchases p
JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- 3. Purchases of customer with ID = 5
SELECT * FROM purchases
WHERE customer_id = 5;

-- 4. Purchases for large desk AND small desk
SELECT * FROM purchases
WHERE item_id IN (
    SELECT item_id FROM items WHERE name IN ('Large Desk','Small Desk')
);

-- 5. Show all customers who made a purchase (with item name)
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, i.name AS item_name
FROM purchases p
JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN items i ON p.item_id = i.item_id;

-- 6. Try inserting a row with customer but no item
INSERT INTO purchases (customer_id, item_id, quantity_purchased)
VALUES (1, NULL, 1);
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è This will fail because item_id has a FOREIGN KEY constraint (cannot be NULL).
