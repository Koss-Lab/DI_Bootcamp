suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the output of `print(c1 + c3)` is commented out.  Uncomment it to demonstrate the error handling.
- Add docstrings to functions for better readability and understanding.
- Consider adding input validation to `minutes_lived` function to handle incorrect date formats gracefully.
- Improve the `__str__` method in the `Currency` class to handle cases with amounts of 0 or 1, (e.g. '1 dollar' instead of '1 dollars').
- In Exercise 2, the `func.py` file is missing. The code relies on its existence. You should include that file in your submission.
